            <h1>Why the magazine.</h1>
            <p class="meta">January 14, 2026 • Editor In Chief</p>

            <p>The decision to set up a magazine has long been something I have personally desired. I did not find the support I expected when I shared the idea with schoolmates. That is why I took matters into my own hands. That is also partially why I will be running this magazine anonymously, and will hand control over to whoever is most invested in it by the end of the year, ان شاء الله.</p>

            <p>I hope this magazine will grow into an actual domain of intellectual growth and exchange of ideas, in what positively impacts society.</p>

            <h2>Why a magazine?</h2>
            
            <p>The launch of a debate club has been a catalyst for this decision. The debate club is, in my eyes, the embodiment of authoritarianism; you will not be free to express your own thoughts, you will be bound by a topic the school administration picks, and of which the ministry approves, under the complete control and involvement of the institution.</p>
            <P>Such a debate club is counterproductive. It will not, by its own nature, elaborate on sensitive topics, or display the will of the students for change.</P>
            <P>Imagine a restaurant, at which you cannot pick what to eat. Imagine an arcade, at which you cannot pick what to play. Imagine a place to think, at which you do not pick what to think. What to think is imposed on you by the institution, which overtly runs the debate club, as a supposed place to unleash creativity in the face of the institution.</P>
            <p>This is natural, given the debate club is an extension of the institute. To think elsewise screams naïveté.</p>
            
            <h3>Why the magazine should not fall into this.</h3>

            <p>The magazine is on the cloud. The school has no authority over it. Anything, within the guidelines, can be said or expressed on it. Think of it as an ethical silk road for thought.</p>

            <p>eh oui</p>

            <p>I don't think there is anything else to say.</p>
